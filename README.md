# Team Contract

**Is it acceptable for one or two team members to do more work than the others
in order to get the team an A?**

Answer: NO

**How will you use the in-class time?**

We will spend our in class time discussing how the work should be divided up.

**How often will you meet outside of class?**

We will meet at least 2 times before submitting the lab.

**How will work be divided among team members?**

Every person is assigned work based on how the project can be chunked into pieces.

**What will you do if one or more team members are not doing their share of the work?**

We will ask them if they need help. If they are not doing work on purpose, we will complete their share of the work and report it to the professor.


**How will you track who is responsible for which tasks and the work progress?**

Using the following table
